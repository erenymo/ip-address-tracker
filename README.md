# IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./src/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

The challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app. To get the IP Address locations, I used the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) helped me a lot.

You can reach out the live website [Here!](https://erenymo-ip-tracker.netlify.app/)

The features I implemented to this website, users should:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
